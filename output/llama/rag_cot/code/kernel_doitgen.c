To optimize the code for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we need to consider the following factors:

1.  Loop unrolling: Loop unrolling can help to reduce the number of iterations, which can improve the performance of the code. However, it can also increase the memory usage, so it should be used judiciously.

2.  Pipeline stages: Pipelining can help to improve the throughput of the code by breaking down the computation into smaller stages. This can be particularly effective for codes that have a large number of iterations.

3.  Memory optimization: Memory optimization can help to reduce the memory usage of the code, which can improve the performance. This can be achieved by using smaller data types, reducing the number of variables, and using memory-efficient data structures.

Here is the optimized code with HLS pragmas:

```c
void kernel_doitgen(int nr, int nq, int np, float A[25][20][30], float C4[30][30], float sum[30]) {
    #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=A offset=slave bundle=gmem
    #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=C4 offset=slave bundle=gmem
    #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=sum offset=slave bundle=gmem

    #pragma HLS DATAFLOW

    #pragma HLS pipeline II=1
    #pragma HLS pipeline enable_feedback

    int r;
    int q;
    int p;
    int s;

    #pragma HLS loop_tripcount min=1 max=25
    #pragma HLS loop_tripcount min=1 max=20
    #pragma HLS loop_tripcount min=1 max=30
    #pragma HLS loop_tripcount min=1 max=30

    for (r = 0; r < 25; r++) {
        #pragma HLS loop_pipeline enable
        for (q = 0; q < 20; q++) {
            for (p = 0; p < 30; p++) {
                sum[p] = 0.0;
                #pragma HLS loop_unroll factor=8
                for (s = 0; s < 30; s++) {
                    sum[p] += A[r][q][s] * C4[s][p];
                }
            }
            #pragma HLS loop_unroll factor=8
            for (p = 0; p < 30; p++) {
                A[r][q][p] = sum[p];
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this code, we have used the following HLS pragmas:

*   `#pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi`: This directive specifies the interface between the kernel and the memory.

*   `#pragma HLS DATAFLOW`: This directive specifies that the kernel is a dataflow program.

*   `#pragma HLS pipeline II=1`: This directive specifies the pipeline stages.

*   `#pragma HLS loop_tripcount`: This directive specifies the minimum and maximum number of iterations for a loop.

*   `#pragma HLS loop_pipeline enable`: This directive enables the pipeline for a loop.

*   `#pragma HLS loop_unroll factor=8`: This directive specifies the unrolling factor for a loop.

The above code is optimized for performance and memory usage. It uses pipelining and loop unrolling to improve the performance, and it uses memory-efficient data structures to reduce the memory usage.
