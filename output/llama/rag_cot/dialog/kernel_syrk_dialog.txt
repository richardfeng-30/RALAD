You are given some HLS pragma insertion examples.

Example 1: 
for k = 0, . . . , N − 1

(5.13)

n=0

We can divide this equation into two parts, one that sums the even components and one that
sums the odd components.
N/2−1

N/2−1

G[k] =

X

g[2n] · e

−j2πk(2n)
N

+

n=0

X

g[2n + 1] · e

−j2πk(2n+1)
N

(5.14)

n=0

The first part of this equation deals with the even inputs, hence the 2n terms in both g[] and in
the exponent of e. The second part corresponds to the odd inputs with 2n + 1 in both places. Also
note that the sums now go to N/2 − 1 in both cases which should make sense since we have divided
them into two halves.
We transform Equation 5.14 to the following:
N/2−1

G[k] =

X
n=0

g[2n] · e

−j2πkn

and

(3.25)

The scaling factors for different iterations can be calculated in advance and stored in a table. If we
always perform a fixed number of rotations, this is simply one constant. This correction could also
be made in advance by scaling v0 appropriately before performing the rotations. Sometimes it is
ok to ignore this scaling, which results in a processing gain

In the first summation (even inputs), we simply move the 2 into the denominator so that it is
now N/2. The second summation (odd inputs) uses the power rule to separate the +1 leaving two
complex exponentials. We can further modify this equation to
N/2−1

G[k] =

X

N/2−1

−j2πkn

g[2n] · e N/2 + e

−j2πk

−j2πkn

g[2n + 1] · e N/2

(5.16)

n=0

Here we only modify the second summation. First we pull one of the complex exponentials outside
of the summation since it does not depend upon n. And we also move the 2 into the denominator
as we did before in the first summation. Note that both summations now have the same complex
−j2πkn

exponential e N/2 . Finally, we simplify this to
G[k] = Ak + WNk Bk

Optimize the following code by inserting pragma HLS lines. Before responding with any code, think step by step about the HLS optimizations that will improve performance and explain your reasoning. Finally, generate the C code with pragma HLS.
void kernel_syrk(int n,int m,float alpha,float beta,float C[80][80],float A[80][60])
{
  int i;
  int j;
  int k;
//BLAS PARAMS
//TRANS = 'N'
//UPLO  = 'L'
// =>  Form  C := alpha*A*A**T + beta*C.
//A is NxM
//C is NxN
{
    
    
    
    for (i = 0; i < 80; i++) {
      for (j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
        C[i][j] *= beta;
      }
      
      
      
      for (k = 0; k < 60; k++) {
        for (j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
          C[i][j] += alpha * A[i][k] * A[j][k];
        }
      }
    }
  }
}


=== LLAMA RESPONSE ===
Here is the optimized C code with HLS pragmas:

```c
void kernel_syrk(int n,int m,float alpha,float beta,float C[80][80],float A[80][60])
{
  #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=C offset=slave bundle=gmem
  #pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=A offset=slave bundle=gmem
  #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axli port=n offset=slave bundle=acc_ctrl
  #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axli port=m offset=slave bundle=acc_ctrl
  #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axli port=alpha offset=slave bundle=acc_ctrl
  #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axli port=beta offset=slave bundle=acc_ctrl
  #pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axpport offset=slave bundle=acc_ctrl
  
  int i;
  int j;
  int k;
  
  #pragma HLS loop_tripcount min=1 max=80
  #pragma HLS loop_tripcount min=1 max=80
  #pragma HLS loop_tripcount min=1 max=60
  
  for (i = 0; i < 80; i++) {
    #pragma HLS loop_tripcount min=1 max=i
    for (j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
      C[i][j] *= beta;
    }
    
    #pragma HLS loop_unroll
    for (k = 0; k < 60; k++) {
      #pragma HLS loop_tripcount min=1 max=i
      for (j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
        C[i][j] += alpha * A[i][k] * A[j][k];
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this code, I have added HLS pragmas to optimize the performance of the kernel_syrk function. The pragmas I have added are:

*   `#pragma HLS INTERFACE`: This directive is used to specify the interfaces for the kernel function. In this case, I have specified the interfaces for the input and output arrays, as well as the scalar inputs.
*   `#pragma HLS LOOP_TRIPCOUNT`: This directive is used to specify the trip count for a loop. In this case, I have specified the trip count for the outer loop to be between 1 and 80, and for the inner loops to be between 1 and the value of the outer loop variable.
*   `#pragma HLS LOOP_UNROLL`: This directive is used to specify whether a loop should be unrolled. In this case, I have specified that the inner loop should be unrolled.

By adding these pragmas, the HLS compiler can optimize the kernel function for performance by reducing the number of memory accesses and improving the cache locality.
