=== SYSTEM ===
Always answer with optimized C code including HLS pragmas. Add appropriate #pragma HLS directives for interfaces, loops, and memory optimization.

=== USER QUERY ===
You are given some HLS pragma insertion examples.

Example 1:

Example 2: 
for computation. Larger FPGAs can have millions of these programmable logic elements.
How would you program the 2-LUT from Figure 1.1 to implement an XOR gate? An OR
gate? How many programming bits does an n input (n-LUT) require?

FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM

In the first summation (even inputs), we simply move the 2 into the denominator so that it is
now N/2. The second summation (odd inputs) uses the power rule to separate the +1 leaving two
complex exponentials. We can further modify this equation to
N/2−1

G[k] =

X

N/2−1

−j2πkn

g[2n] · e N/2 + e

−j2πk
N

·

n=0

X

−j2πkn

g[2n + 1] · e N/2

(5.16)

n=0

Here we only modify the second summation. First we pull one of the complex exponentials outside
of the summation since it does not depend upon n. And we also move the 2 into the denominator
as we did before in the first summation. Note that both summations now have the same complex
−j2πkn

exponential e N/2 . Finally, we simplify this to
G[k] = Ak + WNk Bk

Optimize the following code by inserting pragma HLS lines. Before responding with any code, think step by step about the HLS optimizations that will improve performance and explain your reasoning. Finally, generate the C code with pragma HLS.

void kernel_2mm(int ni,int nj,int nk,int nl,float alpha,float beta,float tmp[40][50],float A[40][70],float B[70][50],float C[50][80],float D[40][80])
{
  int i;
  int j;
  int k;
{
    
    
    
    for (i = 0; i < 40; i++) {
      
      
      
      for (j = 0; j < 50; j++) {
        tmp[i][j] = 0.0;
        
        for (k = 0; k < 70; ++k) {
          tmp[i][j] += alpha * A[i][k] * B[k][j];
        }
      }
    }
    
    
    
    for (i = 0; i < 40; i++) {
      
      
      
      for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
        D[i][j] *= beta;
        
        for (k = 0; k < 50; ++k) {

The HLS pragmas used in this code are:

- `#pragma HLS INTERFACE`: This directive specifies the interface between the kernel and the AXI4-Stream interface. It is used to define the direction and type of the interface.
- `#pragma HLS DATAFLOW`: This directive specifies that the kernel is a dataflow kernel, which means that it can be executed in parallel.
- `#pragma HLS LOOP_FLATTEN`: This directive specifies that the loop should be flattened, which means that the loop should be executed in a linear sequence.
- `#pragma HLS ALLOCATION`: This directive specifies the allocation of resources for the kernel. It is used to specify the number of registers and the size of the memory.

The HLS pragmas are used to optimize the performance of the kernel by:

- Reducing the number of memory accesses
- Increasing the parallelism of the kernel
- Improving the cache locality
- Reducing the number of register spills

The HLS pragmas are used to specify the interface, dataflow, and loop flattening of the kernel. They are used to optimize the performance of the kernel by reducing the number of memory accesses, increasing the parallelism, improving the cache locality, and reducing the number of register spills.
