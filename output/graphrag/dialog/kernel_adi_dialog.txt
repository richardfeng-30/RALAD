### Summary of Optimization Strategies and Pragma Usage

To optimize the given kernel for performance while keeping resource utilization under 80% and compilation time under 1800 seconds, the following strategies and pragmas are recommended based on the knowledge base:

1. **Loop Pipelining**: Applying `#pragma HLS pipeline` to the outer loop (time steps loop) can improve throughput by initiating a new iteration every clock cycle (II=1). This is a fundamental optimization in Vitis HLS to increase performance [Data: OPTIMIZATION DIRECTIVES (213); LOOP_OPTIMIZATIONS (4955)].

2. **Loop Unrolling**: Partial unrolling of inner loops with a moderate factor (e.g., 4) increases parallelism and throughput without excessive resource usage or compilation time. Full unrolling might increase resource usage beyond the 80% target and increase compile time significantly [Data: PRAGMA HLS UNROLL (3228); LOOP_OPTIMIZATIONS (4955)].

3. **Pragmas Placement**: Pragmas are embedded directly in the source code to ensure they are applied automatically during synthesis [Data: SOURCE FILE (2584); PRAGMAS (357)].

4. **Balancing Resource and Performance**: Partial unrolling and pipelining are balanced to improve performance while controlling resource utilization and compile time [Data: OPTIMIZATION DIRECTIVES (213); PRAGMA_HLS_PERFORMANCE (303)].

These optimizations are standard practice in Vitis HLS to improve performance of nested loops in computational kernels like ADI (Alternating Direction Implicit) methods.

By applying these pragmas, the kernel should achieve improved throughput with controlled resource usage and manageable compilation time. Further tuning of unroll factors and pipelining initiation intervals can be done based on synthesis reports and resource utilization feedback.
