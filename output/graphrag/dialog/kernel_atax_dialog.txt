### Summary of Relevant HLS Optimization Strategies and Pragmas

To optimize the given `kernel_atax` function for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), the following strategies and pragmas are commonly used:

1. **Loop Pipelining (`#pragma HLS PIPELINE`)**: This pragma enables initiation interval (II) of 1 for loops, allowing new iterations to start every clock cycle, thus increasing throughput.

2. **Loop Unrolling (`#pragma HLS UNROLL`)**: Unrolling loops increases parallelism by replicating hardware for loop iterations. Partial unrolling can balance resource usage and performance.

3. **Array Partitioning (`#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION`)**: Partitioning arrays into smaller blocks or completely into registers allows parallel access to multiple elements, reducing memory bottlenecks.

4. **Dataflow (`#pragma HLS DATAFLOW`)**: Enables concurrent execution of different functions or loops, improving overall throughput by overlapping operations.

5. **Interface Pragmas (`#pragma HLS INTERFACE`)**: Define memory interfaces and optimize data transfer bandwidth.

6. **Loop Flattening (`#pragma HLS LOOP_FLATTEN`)**: Flattens nested loops into a single loop to improve pipeline efficiency.

Given the nested loops and array accesses in `kernel_atax`, applying loop pipelining and array partitioning pragmas will be effective. Complete partitioning of the `tmp` array and partial partitioning of the `A` matrix and vectors `x` and `y` can improve parallel access. Loop unrolling can be applied carefully to inner loops to increase parallelism without exceeding resource limits.

  // Initialize y array
  init_y: for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {

  atax_outer: for (i = 0; i < 116; i++) {
    #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1
    tmp[i] = 0.0f;

    atax_inner1: for (j = 0; j < 124; j++) {
      #pragma HLS UNROLL factor=4
      tmp[i] += A[i][j] * x[j];
    }

    atax_inner2: for (j = 0; j < 124; j++) {
      #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1
      y[j] += A[i][j] * tmp[i];
    }
  }
}
```

### Explanation of Inserted Pragmas

- **Interface Pragmas**: Define AXI master interfaces for arrays and control ports to optimize data transfer and control signaling.

- **Array Partitioning**: 
  - `tmp` is completely partitioned to allow simultaneous access to all elements, enabling parallel updates.
  - `x` and `y` are cyclically partitioned with a factor of 8 to balance resource usage and parallel access.
  - `A` is cyclically partitioned along the second dimension (columns) to allow parallel access to multiple elements in the inner loops.

- **Loop Pipelining**: Applied to the outer loop and initialization loop to enable continuous processing with initiation interval 1.

- **Loop Unrolling**: Applied partially (factor 4) to the first inner loop to increase parallelism in the multiply-accumulate operations without excessive resource usage.

- **Loop Pipelining in Second Inner Loop**: Ensures the accumulation into `y` is also pipelined for throughput.

This combination of pragmas aims to maximize parallelism and throughput while controlling resource utilization and keeping compilation time reasonable. Adjusting the unroll factor and partitioning factors can further tune the balance between performance and resource usage.

This approach is consistent with best practices in HLS optimization, such as those demonstrated in matrix multiplication and dataflow examples [Data: Entities (78, 104, 4337); Relationships (95, 96, 98, 155, 156)].
