### Summary of Relevant HLS Optimization Strategies and Pragmas

To optimize the given kernel for performance while controlling resource utilization and compilation time, several HLS optimization strategies and pragmas can be applied:

1. **Loop Pipelining (`#pragma HLS PIPELINE`)**  
   Pipelining loops allows initiation of new loop iterations before previous ones complete, increasing throughput. Applying this to inner loops can significantly improve performance but may increase resource usage.

2. **Loop Unrolling (`#pragma HLS UNROLL`)**  
   Unrolling loops replicates hardware to execute multiple iterations in parallel, improving performance at the cost of increased resource usage. Partial unrolling can balance performance and resource constraints.

3. **Array Partitioning (`#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION`)**  
   Partitioning arrays into smaller blocks or completely partitioning them enables parallel access to multiple elements, reducing memory bottlenecks and improving throughput.

4. **Dependence Pragmas (`#pragma HLS DEPENDENCE`)**  
   These pragmas inform the compiler about data dependencies, allowing more aggressive optimizations like pipelining when dependencies are false or manageable.

5. **Resource Allocation Control (`#pragma HLS ALLOCATION`)**  
   Limits the number of hardware resources (e.g., multipliers) used, helping keep resource utilization under a target threshold.

6. **Loop Flattening (`#pragma HLS LOOP_FLATTEN`)**  
   Flattening nested loops can improve pipeline efficiency by reducing loop overhead.

7. **Interface Pragmas**  
   Specifying interfaces (e.g., AXI) can improve data transfer efficiency but is not directly relevant here unless interfacing with external memory.

From the knowledge base, these strategies have been successfully applied in matrix multiplication and similar kernels to improve throughput while managing resource usage [Data: Entities (78, 213, 303, 292), Relationships (97, 98, 96, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107)].

### Applying Pragmas to `kernel_bicg`

The kernel performs two main operations:

- Initialization of array `s` to zero.
- Nested loops updating arrays `s` and `q` based on matrix `A` and vectors `r` and `p`.

To optimize:

- **Pipeline the inner loop** to increase throughput.
- **Partition arrays `s`, `p`, and possibly `A`** to allow parallel access.
- **Use dependence pragmas** to inform the compiler that updates to `s[j]` in the inner loop are safe for pipelining.
- **Consider partial unrolling** of the inner loop if resource usage allows.
- **Pipeline the outer loops** where possible.

### Final Optimized Code with Pragmas

```c
void kernel_bicg(int m, int n, float A[124][116], float s[116], float q[124], float p[116], float r[124])
{
    int i, j;

    // Initialize s array to zero with pipelined loop
    init_s:
    for (i = 0; i < 116; i++) {
        #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1
        s[i] = 0.0f;
    }

    // Main computation
    outer_loop:
    for (i = 0; i < 124; i++) {
        #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1
        q[i] = 0.0f;

        inner_loop:
        for (j = 0; j < 116; j++) {
            #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1
            #pragma HLS DEPENDENCE variable=s inter false
            s[j] += r[i] * A[i][j];
            q[i] += A[i][j] * p[j];
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Inserted Pragmas

- **`#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1`** on loops enables initiation interval of 1, allowing new iterations every clock cycle, maximizing throughput.
- **`#pragma HLS DEPENDENCE variable=s inter false`** tells the compiler there are no inter-iteration dependencies on `s` that would prevent pipelining, enabling more aggressive optimization.
- Initialization loop for `s` is pipelined to reduce latency.
- The outer loop is also pipelined to improve overall throughput.
- Arrays `s`, `p`, and `A` could be further optimized with array partitioning if resource usage allows, but this depends on synthesis results and resource constraints.

### Additional Notes

- If resource utilization exceeds 80%, consider reducing unrolling or pipelining aggressiveness.
- Compilation time under 1800s should be achievable with these pragmas, but very aggressive unrolling or complex partitioning may increase compile time.
- Further optimizations like array partitioning or resource allocation pragmas can be added based on synthesis feedback.

This approach balances performance improvement with resource and compile time constraints, leveraging proven HLS optimization techniques [Data: Entities (213, 303, 78); Relationships (97, 98, 4366, 4370)].
