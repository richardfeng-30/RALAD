To optimize the given 2D Seidel kernel for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several well-known optimization strategies and pragmas that improve performance by enabling pipelining, reducing memory bottlenecks, and improving data access patterns. At the same time, we must be mindful of resource utilization and compilation time constraints.

### Relevant Optimization Strategies and Pragmas

1. **Loop Pipelining**: Applying `#pragma HLS PIPELINE` to the innermost loop can reduce the initiation interval (II), allowing new iterations to start every clock cycle, thus increasing throughput.

2. **Array Partitioning**: Using `#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION` on the array dimensions can enable parallel access to array elements, reducing memory access conflicts and improving performance.

3. **Array Stencil Optimization**: The `#pragma HLS ARRAY_STENCIL` pragma can optimize sliding window accesses in stencil computations like this one, improving memory efficiency.

4. **Loop Unrolling**: Partial or complete unrolling of loops can increase parallelism but may increase resource usage. It should be applied carefully to stay within resource limits.

5. **Interface Pragmas**: Specifying the interface pragmas for the kernel arguments can improve data transfer efficiency.

6. **Tripcount Pragmas**: Providing loop tripcount information helps the HLS tool optimize loops better and estimate performance.

### Summary from Knowledge Base

- Pipelining loops with `#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1` is a common technique to improve throughput in nested loops [Data: Relationships (4635, 8791)].
- Using `#pragma HLS ARRAY_STENCIL` on the input array can optimize memory accesses for stencil operations [Data: Relationships (8792, 8795)].
- Buffering and restructuring code to reduce memory loads per cycle can reduce initiation interval and improve performance [Data: Entities (23, 22, 20)].
- Complete or partial array partitioning can enable parallel access to array elements, but must be balanced against resource usage [Data: Relationships (8126, 8128)].
- Loop tripcount pragmas help the tool infer performance constraints [Data: Relationships (4636, 8911)].
- Interface pragmas such as `m_axi` and `s_axilite` improve data transfer and control [Data: Relationships (8790, 8789, 8793)].

### Optimized Code with Pragmas

Below is the optimized version of your kernel with pragmas inserted to enable pipelining, array stencil optimization, and interface specification. The array is also partitioned along the inner dimension to allow parallel access to columns, which is beneficial for 2D stencil computations. Loop tripcount pragmas are added to help the tool optimize loops.

```c
void kernel_seidel_2d(int tsteps, int n, float A[120][120]) {
#pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=A offset=slave bundle=gmem0
#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=tsteps bundle=control
#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=n bundle=control
#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=A bundle=control
#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=return bundle=control

#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=A complete dim=2
#pragma HLS ARRAY_STENCIL variable=A

  int t, i, j;

  // Provide tripcount pragmas to help optimization
#pragma HLS LOOP_TRIPCOUNT min=40 max=40
  for (t = 0; t < tsteps; t++) {
#pragma HLS LOOP_TRIPCOUNT min=118 max=118
    for (i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
#pragma HLS LOOP_TRIPCOUNT min=118 max=118
#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1
      for (j = 1; j < n - 1; j++) {
        A[i][j] = (A[i - 1][j - 1] + A[i - 1][j] + A[i - 1][j + 1] +
                   A[i][j - 1] + A[i][j] + A[i][j + 1] +
                   A[i + 1][j - 1] + A[i + 1][j] + A[i + 1][j + 1]) / 9.0f;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Explanation

- **Interface Pragmas**: The `m_axi` pragma on array `A` enables efficient memory access via AXI master interface. The `s_axilite` pragmas provide control interface for kernel arguments and return.
- **Array Partitioning**: The array `A` is completely partitioned along the second dimension (columns), allowing parallel access to elements in the inner loop.
- **Array Stencil**: The `ARRAY_STENCIL` pragma optimizes the sliding window memory accesses typical in stencil computations.
- **Loop Tripcount**: Tripcount pragmas inform the tool about loop iteration counts, aiding in optimization and performance estimation.
- **Loop Pipelining**: The innermost loop is pipelined with initiation interval 1, allowing a new iteration every clock cycle, maximizing throughput.

This combination of pragmas and restructuring should significantly improve performance while controlling resource usage and compilation time. Further tuning, such as partial loop unrolling or buffering, can be explored if resource usage is well below 80% and more performance is needed.

This approach is supported by multiple examples and best practices in HLS optimization literature and the knowledge base [Data: Entities (213, 4337, 5715); Relationships (8790, 8791, 8792, 8126, 4635)].
