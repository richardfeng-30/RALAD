To optimize the given 2D Jacobi kernel for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several well-known optimization strategies and pragmas that improve performance while controlling resource usage and compilation time.

### Relevant Optimization Strategies and Pragmas

1. **Loop Pipelining**: Applying `#pragma HLS PIPELINE` to inner loops can significantly improve throughput by enabling concurrent execution of loop iterations with a specified initiation interval (II). Setting II=1 is ideal for maximum throughput but may increase resource usage.

2. **Loop Unrolling**: Partial or full unrolling of inner loops with `#pragma HLS UNROLL` can increase parallelism by replicating hardware. However, full unrolling may increase resource usage beyond the 80% target, so partial unrolling or selective unrolling is preferred.

3. **Array Partitioning**: Using `#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION` on arrays or array dimensions can improve memory bandwidth and enable parallel access to array elements, reducing bottlenecks.

4. **Loop Flattening**: `#pragma HLS LOOP_FLATTEN` can be used to flatten nested loops into a single loop to improve pipeline efficiency.

5. **Dataflow Optimization**: Applying `#pragma HLS DATAFLOW` to enable concurrent execution of independent functions or loops can improve throughput but may increase resource usage and compilation time.

6. **Resource and Latency Trade-offs**: Balancing unrolling and pipelining pragmas to keep resource utilization under 80% and compilation time under 1800s is critical. Starting with pipelining and selective unrolling is a good approach.

### Summary from Knowledge Base

- Optimization directives in Vitis HLS include pipelining, unrolling, loop flattening, and array partitioning to improve performance and resource utilization [Data: OPTIMIZATION DIRECTIVES (213, 6260, 4337)].
- Loop pipelining with initiation interval 1 (`#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1`) is effective for inner loops to increase throughput [Data: MATRIXMULTIPLICATION (97)].
- Array partitioning can be applied to 2D arrays to enable parallel access and reduce memory bottlenecks [Data: ARRAY_PARTITION_EXAMPLE_4 (3141)].
- Loop unrolling increases parallelism but should be used judiciously to control resource usage [Data: MATRIXMULTIPLICATION (98)].
- Loop flattening can improve pipeline efficiency in nested loops [Data: MATRIXMULTIPLICATION (96)].
- Pragmas should be embedded directly in the source code to ensure consistent application during synthesis [Data: SOURCE FILE (2584)].

### Applying Pragmas to the Jacobi Kernel

Given the nested loops and array accesses, the following pragmas are appropriate:

- Pipeline the inner `j` loops with `II=1` to maximize throughput.
- Partition the arrays `A` and `B` along the second dimension (columns) to allow parallel access to elements in the inner loop.
- Optionally, partially unroll the inner loop `j` to increase parallelism without excessive resource usage.
- Flatten the `i` and `j` loops if beneficial, but since `i` and `j` are nested with similar bounds, pipelining the inner loop may suffice.

### Final Optimized Code with Pragmas

```c
void kernel_jacobi_2d(int tsteps, int n, float A[90][90], float B[90][90]) {
#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=A complete dim=2
#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=B complete dim=2

  int t, i, j;

  for (t = 0; t < 40; t++) {
    for (i = 1; i < 90 - 1; i++) {
#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1
      for (j = 1; j < 90 - 1; j++) {
#pragma HLS UNROLL factor=4
        B[i][j] = 0.2 * (A[i][j] + A[i][j - 1] + A[i][j + 1] + A[i + 1][j] + A[i - 1][j]);
      }
    }

    for (i = 1; i < 90 - 1; i++) {
#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1
      for (j = 1; j < 90 - 1; j++) {
#pragma HLS UNROLL factor=4
        A[i][j] = 0.2 * (B[i][j] + B[i][j - 1] + B[i][j + 1] + B[i + 1][j] + B[i - 1][j]);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Explanation

- `#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=A complete dim=2` and similarly for `B` partitions the arrays along the column dimension, enabling parallel access to elements in the inner loop.
- `#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1` on the `j` loop allows pipelined execution with initiation interval 1, maximizing throughput.
- `#pragma HLS UNROLL factor=4` partially unrolls the inner loop by a factor of 4, increasing parallelism while controlling resource usage.
- The outer `i` loop is left unrolled to avoid excessive resource usage and compilation time.
- These pragmas balance performance improvement with resource and compilation time constraints.

This approach should improve the kernel's throughput significantly while keeping resource utilization under 80% and compilation time manageable, based on common HLS optimization practices [Data: OPTIMIZATION DIRECTIVES (213, 6260, 4337); ARRAY_PARTITION_EXAMPLE_4 (3141); MATRIXMULTIPLICATION (96, 97, 98)].

If further tuning is needed, adjusting the unroll factor or applying loop flattening pragmas can be explored.
