To optimize the given matrix multiplication kernel for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), we can apply several well-known pragma directives and code restructuring techniques to improve throughput while controlling resource usage and compilation time.

### Summary of Relevant Optimization Strategies and Pragmas

1. **Loop Pipelining (`#pragma HLS PIPELINE`)**  
   Applying pipelining to loops allows initiation of new loop iterations before previous ones complete, increasing throughput. The inner loops, especially the multiply-accumulate loops, benefit greatly from pipelining.

2. **Loop Unrolling (`#pragma HLS UNROLL`)**  
   Unrolling inner loops increases parallelism by replicating hardware resources. However, full unrolling can increase resource usage significantly, so partial unrolling or selective unrolling is preferred to keep resource utilization under control.

3. **Loop Flattening (`#pragma HLS LOOP_FLATTEN`)**  
   Flattening nested loops can improve pipeline efficiency by merging loops into a single loop, reducing pipeline stalls.

4. **Array Partitioning (`#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION`)**  
   Partitioning arrays, especially the input matrices, can enable parallel access to multiple elements, reducing memory bottlenecks.

5. **Resource Allocation Control (`#pragma HLS ALLOCATION`)**  
   This pragma controls the number of hardware resources (e.g., multipliers) used, helping to keep resource usage under a target threshold.

6. **Interface Pragmas (`#pragma HLS INTERFACE`)**  
   Specifying interfaces for arrays and function arguments can improve data transfer efficiency.

7. **Inlining and Function Instantiation**  
   For modular code, inlining small functions can reduce overhead and improve performance.

### Applying Pragmas to the Provided Code

Given the kernel operates on fixed-size arrays (60x70, 60x80, 80x70), we can apply pragmas to the loops and arrays to optimize performance while controlling resource usage.

- Pipeline the outer `i` loop or the inner `j` loop to improve throughput.
- Unroll the innermost `j` loop partially to balance parallelism and resource usage.
- Partition arrays `A` and `B` to enable parallel access.
- Use loop flattening to improve pipeline efficiency.
- Control resource allocation to keep utilization under 80%.

### Final Optimized Code with Pragmas

```c
void kernel_gemm(int ni, int nj, int nk, float alpha, float beta, float C[60][70], float A[60][80], float B[80][70])
{
#pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=C offset=slave bundle=gmem0
#pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=A offset=slave bundle=gmem1
#pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=B offset=slave bundle=gmem2
#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=ni bundle=control
#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=nj bundle=control
#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=nk bundle=control
#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=alpha bundle=control
#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=beta bundle=control
#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=C bundle=control
#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=A bundle=control
#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=B bundle=control
#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=return bundle=control

    // Partition arrays to enable parallel access
#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=A cyclic factor=8 dim=2
#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=B cyclic factor=8 dim=1
#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=C cyclic factor=8 dim=2

    // Pipeline the outer loop to improve throughput
    for (int i = 0; i < 60; i++) {
#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1

        // Scale C by beta
        for (int j = 0; j < 70; j++) {
#pragma HLS UNROLL factor=4
            C[i][j] *= beta;
        }

        // Compute alpha * A * B and accumulate into C
        for (int k = 0; k < 80; k++) {
#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1
            for (int j = 0; j < 70; j++) {
#pragma HLS UNROLL factor=4
                C[i][j] += alpha * A[i][k] * B[k][j];
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Applied Pragmas

- **Interface Pragmas:** Define AXI master interfaces for arrays and AXI-lite interfaces for scalar parameters to enable efficient data transfer between host and FPGA.
- **Array Partitioning:** The arrays `A`, `B`, and `C` are partitioned cyclically with a factor of 8 along the dimension that is accessed in the inner loops. This allows multiple elements to be accessed in parallel, reducing memory bottlenecks.
- **Loop Pipelining:** The outer `i` loop and the `k` loop are pipelined with an initiation interval (II) of 1, allowing new iterations to start every clock cycle, maximizing throughput.
- **Loop Unrolling:** The inner `j` loops are partially unrolled by a factor of 4 to increase parallelism without excessive resource usage.
  
This combination balances performance improvement and resource usage, aiming to keep utilization under 80% and compilation time reasonable. Further tuning of unroll factors and partition sizes can be done based on synthesis reports.
