### Summary of Relevant Optimization Strategies and Pragmas for HLS

In High-Level Synthesis (HLS), optimizing nested loops such as those in the Floyd-Warshall algorithm involves several key strategies:

1. **Loop Pipelining**: This allows overlapping the execution of loop iterations to improve throughput. Applying `#pragma HLS pipeline` to the innermost loop or loops with high iteration counts can significantly reduce latency.

2. **Loop Unrolling**: Unrolling loops replicates the loop body multiple times, increasing parallelism. Partial unrolling can balance resource usage and performance. The pragma `#pragma HLS unroll factor=<N>` is used for this purpose.

3. **Loop Flattening**: Flattening nested loops into a single loop can reduce loop control overhead and improve pipeline efficiency. The pragma `#pragma HLS loop_flatten` can be applied to nested loops.

4. **Array Partitioning**: Partitioning arrays into smaller blocks or individual elements enables concurrent access, reducing memory bottlenecks. This is done with `#pragma HLS array_partition variable=path complete` or cyclic/block partitioning.

5. **Dataflow Optimization**: For loops that can be expressed as independent tasks, dataflow can be used to enable concurrent execution of different loop stages.

6. **Tripcount Specification**: Specifying loop trip counts helps the HLS tool optimize pipeline initiation intervals and resource allocation.

7. **Resource Constraints**: To keep resource utilization under 80%, pragmas should be balanced between aggressive unrolling/pipelining and resource usage.

For the Floyd-Warshall kernel, the triple nested loops are a classic candidate for pipelining and partial unrolling, especially the innermost loop. However, full unrolling of all loops would likely exceed resource constraints. Array partitioning of the `path` matrix can improve memory access parallelism.

### Example Pragmas from Knowledge Base

- `#pragma HLS pipeline II=1` to pipeline loops with initiation interval 1.
- `#pragma HLS unroll factor=4` to partially unroll loops.
- `#pragma HLS array_partition variable=path cyclic factor=4 dim=2` to partition the second dimension of the 2D array cyclically.
- `#pragma HLS loop_flatten` to flatten nested loops.
- `#pragma HLS loop_tripcount min=180 max=180` to specify loop bounds for optimization.

These pragmas are commonly used in Vitis HLS to optimize loops and arrays for performance while controlling resource usage [Data: Entities (869, 4139, 3228, 61, 357)].

### Optimized C Code with Pragmas Inserted

```c
void kernel_floyd_warshall(int n, int path[180][180])
{
    int i, j, k;

    // Partition the second dimension of path array cyclically to enable parallel access
    #pragma HLS array_partition variable=path cyclic factor=4 dim=2

    // Flatten the outer two loops to reduce loop control overhead
    #pragma HLS loop_flatten

    for (k = 0; k < 180; k++) {
        for (i = 0; i < 180; i++) {
            // Pipeline the innermost loop to improve throughput
            #pragma HLS pipeline II=1
            for (j = 0; j < 180; j++) {
                int via_k = path[i][k] + path[k][j];
                if (path[i][j] > via_k) {
                    path[i][j] = via_k;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Inserted Pragmas

- **Array Partitioning**: The `path` array is partitioned cyclically along the second dimension with a factor of 4. This allows multiple elements in a row to be accessed in parallel, reducing memory access bottlenecks.

- **Loop Flattening**: Flattening the outer two loops (`k` and `i`) reduces the overhead of nested loop control and can improve pipeline efficiency.

- **Loop Pipelining**: The innermost loop (`j`) is pipelined with an initiation interval (II) of 1, allowing a new iteration to start every clock cycle, maximizing throughput.

This combination balances performance improvement with resource usage, aiming to keep utilization under 80% and compilation time reasonable. Further tuning of unroll factors or partitioning can be done based on synthesis reports.

---

If more aggressive optimization is needed and resource usage allows, partial unrolling of the innermost loop can be considered, for example:

```c
#pragma HLS unroll factor=2
```

inside the innermost loop, but this should be verified against resource constraints.
