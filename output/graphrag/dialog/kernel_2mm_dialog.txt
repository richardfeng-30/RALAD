### Summary of Relevant Pragmas and Optimization Strategies for HLS

To optimize the given matrix multiplication kernel in Vitis HLS, several well-known pragma directives and strategies can be applied:

1. **Loop Pipelining (`#pragma HLS PIPELINE`)**  
   This directive enables overlapping execution of loop iterations, improving throughput by reducing the initiation interval (II). Applying pipelining to inner loops is critical for performance.

2. **Loop Unrolling (`#pragma HLS UNROLL`)**  
   Unrolling loops replicates hardware to execute multiple iterations in parallel, increasing parallelism and throughput. However, it increases resource usage, so partial unrolling or selective unrolling is often used to balance resource constraints.

3. **Array Partitioning (`#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION`)**  
   Partitioning arrays into smaller memories or registers allows concurrent access to multiple elements, reducing memory bottlenecks and enabling parallelism in loops.

4. **Loop Flattening (`#pragma HLS LOOP_FLATTEN`)**  
   Flattening nested loops into a single loop can improve pipeline efficiency by reducing loop overhead and enabling better scheduling.

5. **Resource Allocation Control (`#pragma HLS ALLOCATION`)**  
   This directive controls the number of hardware resources (e.g., multipliers) used, helping to keep resource utilization under a target threshold.

6. **Dataflow Optimization (`#pragma HLS DATAFLOW`)**  
   Enables concurrent execution of different functions or loops, improving throughput by overlapping stages of computation.

### Applying These Strategies to `kernel_2mm`

The kernel performs two matrix multiplications:  
- `tmp = alpha * A * B`  
- `D = beta * D + tmp * C`

To optimize:

- Pipeline the innermost loops to improve throughput.  
- Unroll inner loops partially or fully depending on resource constraints.  
- Partition arrays `tmp` and `D` to allow concurrent accesses.  
- Consider loop flattening for outer loops if beneficial.  
- Use resource allocation pragmas if resource usage is high.  
- Optionally, apply dataflow to overlap the two matrix multiplications.

### Final Optimized Code with Pragmas

```c
void kernel_2mm(int ni,int nj,int nk,int nl,float alpha,float beta,float tmp[40][50],float A[40][70],float B[70][50],float C[50][80],float D[40][80])
{
  int i, j, k;

  // Partition tmp and D arrays to enable parallel access
  #pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=tmp complete dim=2
  #pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=D complete dim=2

  // First matrix multiplication: tmp = alpha * A * B
  for (i = 0; i < 40; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < 50; j++) {
      #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1
      tmp[i][j] = 0.0f;
      for (k = 0; k < 70; ++k) {
        #pragma HLS UNROLL factor=5
        tmp[i][j] += alpha * A[i][k] * B[k][j];
      }
    }
  }

  // Second matrix multiplication: D = beta * D + tmp * C
  for (i = 0; i < 40; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < 80; j++) {
      #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1
      D[i][j] *= beta;
      for (k = 0; k < 50; ++k) {
        #pragma HLS UNROLL factor=5
        D[i][j] += tmp[i][k] * C[k][j];
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Explanation

- **Array Partitioning**: The second dimension of `tmp` and `D` is fully partitioned to allow simultaneous access to multiple columns, enabling parallel updates in the inner loops. This reduces memory access bottlenecks.  
- **Loop Pipelining**: The outer loops over `j` are pipelined with initiation interval 1 to maximize throughput.  
- **Loop Unrolling**: The innermost loops over `k` are unrolled by a factor of 5 to increase parallelism without excessive resource usage. The factor can be tuned to meet the 80% resource utilization target.  
- **Resource and Compilation Time Balance**: Partial unrolling and pipelining balance performance gains with resource and compilation time constraints. Full unrolling might exceed resource limits or increase compile time beyond 1800s.

This approach leverages common HLS optimization techniques to improve throughput while controlling resource usage and compilation time [Data: Entities (213, 4139, 2920, 78, 68); Relationships (97, 98, 96, 103, 105, 106)].

If further optimization is needed, consider applying `#pragma HLS DATAFLOW` to overlap the two matrix multiplications, or use `#pragma HLS ALLOCATION` to limit resource usage explicitly.
