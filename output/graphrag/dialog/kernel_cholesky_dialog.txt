### Summary of Relevant HLS Optimization Strategies and Pragmas

To optimize the given Cholesky decomposition kernel for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), the following strategies and pragmas are commonly used:

1. **Loop Pipelining (`#pragma HLS PIPELINE`)**: This pragma enables initiation interval (II) of 1 or close to 1, allowing the loop to start a new iteration every cycle, thus increasing throughput. It is especially effective for innermost loops with independent iterations or where dependencies can be managed.

2. **Loop Unrolling (`#pragma HLS UNROLL`)**: Unrolling loops increases parallelism by replicating hardware for loop iterations. Partial unrolling can balance resource usage and performance.

3. **Array Partitioning (`#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION`)**: Partitioning arrays into smaller blocks or completely into registers allows parallel access to multiple elements simultaneously, reducing memory bottlenecks.

4. **Loop Flattening (`#pragma HLS LOOP_FLATTEN`)**: Flattening nested loops into a single loop can improve pipeline efficiency by reducing loop overhead.

5. **Dependency Management (`#pragma HLS DEPENDENCE`)**: Declaring false dependencies can help the compiler pipeline loops better when it can prove no real data hazards exist.

6. **Buffering and Local Storage**: Using local buffers to store frequently accessed data can reduce memory access latency.

For matrix computations like Cholesky decomposition, the main challenge is the loop-carried dependencies, especially in the nested loops. Careful pipelining and partial unrolling combined with array partitioning can improve performance while controlling resource usage.

### Applying Pragmas to the Provided Code

The code has three nested loops:

- Outer loop over `i` (0 to 119)
- Middle loop over `j` (0 to i-1)
- Inner loop over `k` (0 to j-1 or i-1)

The inner loops have dependencies due to accumulation and division operations, so full unrolling may be too resource-intensive. Instead, we can:

- Pipeline the innermost loops with an initiation interval of 1.
- Partition the array `A` along the second dimension to allow parallel access to elements `A[i][k]` and `A[j][k]`.
- Possibly unroll the innermost loop partially if resource usage allows.
- Pipeline the middle loop as well, if possible.

### Final Optimized Code with Pragmas

```c
#include <math.h>

void kernel_cholesky(int n, float A[120][120]) {
#pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=A offset=slave bundle=gmem
#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=n bundle=control
#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=return bundle=control

  // Partition the second dimension of A completely to allow parallel access to columns
#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=A complete dim=2

  int i, j, k;

  for (i = 0; i < 120; i++) {
    // Pipeline the j loop to improve throughput
    for (j = 0; j < i; j++) {
#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1
      // Pipeline the k loop with II=1 to allow concurrent multiply-accumulate
      for (k = 0; k < j; k++) {
#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1
        A[i][j] -= A[i][k] * A[j][k];
      }
      A[i][j] /= A[j][j];
    }

    // Pipeline the k loop for diagonal element update
    for (k = 0; k < i; k++) {
#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1
      A[i][i] -= A[i][k] * A[i][k];
    }
    A[i][i] = sqrtf(A[i][i]);
  }
}
```

### Explanation

- The pragma `#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=A complete dim=2` partitions the matrix `A` along its columns, enabling parallel access to multiple elements in the same row, which is critical for the multiply-accumulate operations inside the loops.

- The `#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1` directives on the inner loops allow the HLS tool to initiate a new iteration every clock cycle, improving throughput significantly.

- The interface pragmas specify AXI interfaces for memory and control, which are typical for FPGA kernels.

- We avoid unrolling loops fully to keep resource usage under control, as full unrolling of nested loops in a 120x120 matrix would be very resource-intensive.

This approach balances performance improvement with resource constraints and should keep compilation time reasonable by avoiding excessive unrolling or complex transformations.

### Additional Notes

- If resource usage is still high, consider partial unrolling or tiling the loops to process smaller blocks of the matrix at a time.

- The parameter `n` is included in the interface but not used in the loops; you may want to replace hardcoded `120` with `n` for flexibility.

- Further optimizations could include loop interchange or reordering, but care must be taken due to data dependencies in Cholesky decomposition.

This solution leverages known HLS optimization techniques and pragmas to improve performance while respecting resource and compilation time constraints [Data: Entities (78, 67, 4626); Relationships (97, 98, 96, 103, 105, 106, 107)].
