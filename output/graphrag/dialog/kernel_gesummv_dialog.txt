### Summary of Relevant HLS Optimization Strategies and Pragmas

To optimize the given kernel for High-Level Synthesis (HLS), the following strategies and pragmas are commonly used:

1. **Loop Pipelining (`#pragma HLS PIPELINE`)**  
   Pipelining loops allows initiation of a new iteration before the previous one finishes, increasing throughput and reducing latency. Applying this pragma to inner and/or outer loops can significantly improve performance.

2. **Loop Unrolling (`#pragma HLS UNROLL`)**  
   Unrolling loops replicates hardware to execute multiple iterations in parallel, increasing parallelism at the cost of resource usage. Partial unrolling can balance resource utilization and performance.

3. **Array Partitioning (`#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION`)**  
   Partitioning arrays into smaller blocks or completely partitioning them enables parallel access to multiple elements, reducing memory bottlenecks and improving data throughput.

4. **Loop Flattening (`#pragma HLS LOOP_FLATTEN`)**  
   Flattening nested loops into a single loop can improve pipeline efficiency by reducing loop overhead and enabling better scheduling.

5. **Resource Allocation Control (`#pragma HLS ALLOCATION`)**  
   This pragma controls the number of hardware resources used for specific operations, helping to keep resource utilization under a target threshold.

6. **Function Inlining and Interface Pragmas**  
   While not directly applicable here, these can help optimize kernel interfaces and function calls.

### Example Usage from Knowledge Base

- The **MatrixMultiplication** function uses `#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1` on loops to enable concurrent execution and improve throughput. It also uses `#pragma HLS UNROLL` on inner loops to increase parallelism [Data: Entities (78), Relationships (97, 98)].
- Array partitioning is used to enable parallel access to arrays, improving performance [Data: Relationships (4388, 4389)].
- Loop flattening is applied to nested loops to improve pipeline efficiency [Data: Relationships (96)].
- Pragmas are embedded directly in the source code to ensure directives are applied automatically during synthesis [Data: Relationships (3475)].

### Applying Pragmas to the Provided Code

The kernel has two nested loops: the outer loop over `i` and the inner loop over `j`. The inner loop performs multiply-accumulate operations on arrays `A`, `B`, and `x`. To optimize:

- Pipeline the inner loop to allow initiation interval (II) of 1, maximizing throughput.
- Unroll the inner loop partially or fully depending on resource constraints to increase parallelism.
- Partition arrays `A`, `B`, and `x` to enable parallel memory access.
- Pipeline the outer loop as well if possible, but care must be taken to avoid excessive resource usage.
- Use loop flattening if beneficial.

Given the resource utilization constraint (under 80%) and compilation time constraint (under 1800s), a balanced approach is to pipeline both loops and partially unroll the inner loop, with array partitioning on the input arrays.

### Final Optimized Code with Pragmas

```c
void kernel_gesummv(int n, float alpha, float beta, float A[90][90], float B[90][90], float tmp[90], float x[90], float y[90])
{
#pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=A offset=slave bundle=gmem
#pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=B offset=slave bundle=gmem
#pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=tmp offset=slave bundle=gmem
#pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=x offset=slave bundle=gmem
#pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=y offset=slave bundle=gmem
#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=n bundle=control
#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=alpha bundle=control
#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=beta bundle=control
#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=return bundle=control

  // Partition arrays to enable parallel access
#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=A complete dim=2
#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=B complete dim=2
#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=x complete dim=1

  int i, j;

  // Pipeline outer loop to improve throughput
  for (i = 0; i < 90; i++) {
#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1

    tmp[i] = 0.0;
    y[i] = 0.0;

    // Pipeline and partially unroll inner loop for parallelism
    for (j = 0; j < 90; j++) {
#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1
#pragma HLS UNROLL factor=4

      tmp[i] += A[i][j] * x[j];
      y[i] += B[i][j] * x[j];
    }

    y[i] = alpha * tmp[i] + beta * y[i];
  }
}
```

### Explanation

- **Interface Pragmas**: Added to specify AXI interfaces for arrays and control signals, which is standard for kernels targeting FPGA accelerators.
- **Array Partitioning**: Complete partitioning on the second dimension of `A` and `B` and on `x` to allow simultaneous access to multiple elements, reducing memory bottlenecks.
- **Loop Pipelining**: Applied to both outer and inner loops with initiation interval 1 to maximize throughput.
- **Loop Unrolling**: Partial unrolling of the inner loop by a factor of 4 balances increased parallelism with resource usage.
  
This approach should improve performance significantly while keeping resource usage and compilation time within the specified limits. Further tuning (e.g., adjusting unroll factor) can be done based on synthesis reports.

This optimization approach is supported by examples and best practices in HLS optimization, including matrix multiplication and loop optimization techniques [Data: Entities (78, 213), Relationships (97, 98, 4388, 4389, 96, 3475)].
